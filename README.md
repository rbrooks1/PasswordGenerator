A simple password generator


To run this program:
1. Linux:
    a. Download passGen.cpp to your computer and compile it in the Linux command line using g++ passGen.cpp

2. Windows:
    The best way I've found to create an exe for this is to copy the program into a visual studio project and run it from there
    or you can simply use the .exe I have added into this repo
